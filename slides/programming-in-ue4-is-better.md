Note:
I am a programmer and my viewpoint will be a programmer one.
Don't expect designer / artist info although I'll touch on a few shared subjects.

## My background

Note:
3.5 years with UE4
Plenty of experience with other engines

## My claim

Programming in UE4 is more enjoyable than programming with other engines

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## My one and only metric

Tools-should-not-get-in-your-way-ness

You want to make games, not tools to fix your existing tools.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* Entity-component management
* Programming language choice
* Extensibility & customiziability

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Entity-component management

World -> entities -> components

* The LY bus way
* The U3D singleton problem
* The UE4 middle-ground

Note:
- In LY everything's a message / event
- In U3D components only work on the current entity. No good way to
sync multiple components; Everything's mashed in together

## Programming language choice

- For programmers?
- For designers?
- IDE & tools?

Note:

MonoDevelop? C'mon?
Yes, I know Playmaker exists.

## Extensibility & customizability

Engines aren't set in stone; they are molded to fit the game

Note:

- Engines can't excel at everything so they must be extendable
- True extensibility imposible without source code
- I've seen people completely change the look of their UE4 editor
- Lumberyard:
  - can't post custom rendering tasks
- CryEngine:
  - extending the editor is done by writing MFC in THEIR files
- Unity3D:
  - can't run OpenGL on Windows in the editor
Code Consistency is just as important
UE4's modules Vs. Unity's plugins
- Can I enable / disable stuff?
- Can I unload modules on the fly?
